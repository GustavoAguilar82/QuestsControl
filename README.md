# Getting Started with Create React App

My First React Project ðŸ’š This is a project made in the course of React by Platzi. But I have been pushing some new features to do the 
project more personal. Here, I used Reacts Hooks like useContext and useStated but also I have created a new one (useLocalStorage).
In a near future, the project will be upgraded in the comming React courses and personal ideas~

This portafolio is in proccess, and so many things are coming!!
